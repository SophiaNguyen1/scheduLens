Do you ever reach out to your friends to compare class schedules but forget who you have classes with when they roll around? Or have you wanted to know if any friends are in a specific class but it’s way too time consuming to ask everyone? Some university classes have over 2000 students, and with so many different profs, class times and classes, it’s a hassle to compare schedules and connect with your friends before classes start.

That’s why we created ScheduLens - it’s back to school season and with our web application you can easily figure out if you share classes with any of your friends.

As young students transitioning to university during the pandemic, it was tough for us to deal with the added barrier of social isolation. According to Maslow’s hierarchy of needs, after having our basic needs met such as food, water, and shelter, humans require a sense of belonging and social connection to feel a true sense of happiness. We wanted to dive deeper into this problem and interviewed our peers in university to understand how their social connectivity has been impacted by the pandemic within the past few years. 

95% of our peers reported an increase in negative feelings such as loneliness, anxiety, and depression because of social isolation. This is incredibly concerning and we can see that lacking an interpersonal support system has had a devastating impact on our mental health. However, since we are transitioning back into normal school routines, students need a tool that will help them reconnect with their friends and re-strengthen their bonds.

This is where ScheduLens comes into play. This website is built by students, for students. According to an article on the University of Waterloo’s website, some of the top 10 challenges faced by university students include maintaining friendships and relationships, managing their time with their responsibilities, and taking care of their mental health. ScheduLens aims to ease these burdens through our intuitive, flexible, and accessible features.
